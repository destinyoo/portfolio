        <h3>Design Develope & Deploy</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code 8 years ago because I wanted to make my own websites . Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile friendly web applications and host it on the cloud.</p>

        <h3>AWS Cloud</h3>
        <p>I've successfully hosted my web application on AWS using VPC, EC2, Route 53, Application Load Balancer & target groups, RDS, 
          and CloudWatch. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, available, and secure. I launched an EC2 instance, 
          used an Elastic IP address, and configured a load balancer for high availability. I registered our domain name with Route 53 
          and set up SSL/TLS encryption. For data storage, I used Amazon RDS and set up monitoring using CloudWatch. Overall, this infrastructure 
          will provide us with the scalability, availability, and security we need for our web application.

      <h3>Next-js App & Back-end Sanity.io</h3>
      
      
     <p>
        I recently completed a course where I built a modern portfolio using NEXT.JS, a popular React framework. I added motion graphics and visual effects to my site using Framer Motion, and styled it with the help of Tailwind CSS, a useful utility-first CSS framework.
        To manage my content, I used Sanity.io, a headless CMS that allowed me to structure and manage my content easily without being tied to a specific frontend technology. My portfolio showcases my projects and experience in a professional and engaging manner, which can help me attract potential clients or employers.
        Overall, this project has helped me develop skills in modern web development, including React, server-side rendering, motion graphics, CSS styling, and content management. I am thrilled with the final product and excited to share my work with others. Please check out my portfolio to see all the awesome projects I've worked on!
        Soon I will make it online!

      <p>
        I'm ü§ó  excited to share my recent project setup on AWS! I utilized EC2 running amazon-linux, 
        integrated with Application Load Balancer & target group for high availability, Route 53 for DNS management and
         a Godaddy domain for custom domain name. The end result is a robust, scalable and highly available web application.
          AWS continues to impress me with its powerful set of tools and services.
